  <p> The Art of Living is committed to bringing peace across the globe and happiness to people. It brings a sense of belongingness to people of all walks of life by uniting them under a One Word Family.</p>

<p>The Art of Living is more of a principle, a philosophy of living life to its fullest. It is more a movement than an organization. Its core value is to find peace within oneself and to unite people in our society – of different cultures, traditions, religions, nationalities; and thus reminding us all that we have one goal to uplift human life everywhere.</p>
